# Summary

The evaporation (ET) of water from land surfaces to the atmosphere is a major component of the water 
cycle and accurate estimates of the flux are essential to the water and agricultural sector. As 
direct measurement of ET is difficult, the evaporation flux is often estimated from available 
meteorological data using empirical formulas. There exist a variety of such formulas, where most 
tend to estimate the potential evaporation (PET), which is the maximum amount of water that would 
be evaporated if enough water were available. Consistently implementing these methods is difficult 
due to the significant diversity in the level of input data, process representation, assumptions 
and data requirements. The goal of `PyEt` is to provide a Python package that includes a wide range 
of methods for the estimation of PET, is fully documented and easy to use. Currently, `PyEt` includes 
eighteen different methods to estimate PET and various methods to estimate surface and aerodynamic 
resistance (see Table below). The package allows users to compute and compare potential evaporation 
estimates using different approaches with minimum effort. The structure of the package allows the 
implementation of the methods in other hydrological models or sensitivity analysis.

# Statement of Need

In the Python community, there are already several Python packages that compute evaporation but only
allow one or a maximum of three evaporation methods, e.g. `evaporation` (https://github.com/openmeteo/evaporation),
`PyETo` (https://github.com/woodcrafty/PyETo), `RefET` (https://github.com/WSWUP/RefET). Similar to the
R package `Evapotranspiration` [@Danlu2016r], `PyEt` offers the Python community a reliable and easy to use
package that allows the computation of ET using several well-known models. As the package also includes simple 
evaporation methods that require fewer input data than the commonly used Penman-Monteith method (see table 1), 
`PyEt` can be of great importance in regions with sparsely distributed networks of measurement stations or 
climate change studies, where observations/predictions of wind velocity and humidity are often not available. 
The importance of simple evaporation models and their efficiency in rainfall-runoff models is also discussed 
in [@OUDIN2005290]. 
In this paper, the term `evaporation` reffers to the total evaporation from land, comprising of 
transpiration (evaporation of water from inside the leaves), evaporation from bare soils and interception loss
(evaporation of intercepted precipitation) [@miralles2020].

# Example application

This example shows how `PyEt` can be used to compute potential evaporation using different methods. 
The potential evaporation is estimated for the city of Maribor (Slovenia), using online available 
data from the Slovenian Environmental Agency (ARSO). The potential evaporation is computed using 
four different methods (Penman, Priestley-Taylor, Makking, Hammon) and plotted for comparison.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import pyet

# Import meteorological data 
meteo = pd.read_csv("data/meteo_maribor_2017.csv", parse_dates=True, 
                    index_col="Date")
tmax, tmin, rh, wind, rs = [meteo[col] for col in meteo.columns]

et_penman = pyet.pm(wind, rs=rs, elevation=279, lat=0.813, tmax=tmax, 
					tmin=tmin, rh=rh)
et_pt = pyet.priestley_taylor(wind, rs=rs, elevation=279, lat=0.813, 
							  tmax=tmax, tmin=tmin, rh=rh)
et_mak = pyet.makkink(rs, tmax=tmax, tmin=tmin, elevation=279)
et_hamon = pyet.hamon(tmean.index, tmean, 0.813)
```
In the code above `R_s` is the incoming solar radiation [MJ m-2 d-1], `elevation` the site elevation [m], 
`lat` the the site latitude [rad], `tmax` and `tmin` the maximum and minimum temperature [°C] and 
`rh` the mean relative humidity [%].

# Concluding remarks

This paper presents `PyEt`, a Python package to estimate potential evaporation from available 
meteorological data. Using `PyEt`, users can estimate PET using 18 different methods with only a few lines
of Python-code. At this stage (PyEt v1.0), the methods are implemented for 1D data (e.g. time series data).
Further developments will focus on enabling 2D and 3D data input (Numpy Arrays, Array, and NetCDF files).
The authors believe that `PyEt` will a valuable contribution to the hydrology, meteorology and agricultural 
communities, enabling a simple PET estimation and comparison between different PET estimates. `PyEt` methods 
and estimates can be further used in hydrological models and sensitivity analyses. The `PyEt` design enables
simple extension of the software with new capabilities and new model options. The authors warmly welcome 
code contributions, bug reports, and feedback from the community to improve further improve the package.
`PyEt` is free and open-source software under the LGPL-3.0 license and is available at
http://www.github.com/phydrus/PyEt. Full documentation is available on ReadTheDocs (https://pyet.readthedocs.io). 
The notebook and data necessary to reproduce the Figure in this manuscript are available through PyEt GitHub page.
